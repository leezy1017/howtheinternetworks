<h1> <b> What is DNS? </b></h1>
The Domain Name System (DNS) is one of the establishments of the web, yet the vast majority outside of systems administration most likely don't understand they use it consistently to carry out their responsibilities, browse their email or squander energy on their cell phones. 

At its generally essential, DNS is a catalog of names that coordinate with numbers. The numbers, for this situation are IP addresses, which PCs use to speak with one another. Most depictions of DNS utilize the similarity of a telephone directory, which is fine for individuals beyond 30 a years old realize what a telephone directory is. 
<br>
<b>How DNS server work ? </b>
<br>
The DNS catalog that matches name to numbers isn't found across the board place in some dull corner of the web. With in excess of 332 million space names recorded toward the finish of 2017, a solitary index would be exceptionally huge in reality. Like the web itself, the catalog is circulated the world over, put away on space name servers that all speak with one another consistently to give updates and redundancies. 
<br>
<b>Definitive DNS servers versus recursive DNS servers </b>
<br>
At the point when your PC needs to discover the IP address related with an area name, it first makes its solicitation to a recursive DNS server, otherwise called recursive resolver. A recursive resolver is a server that is typically worked by an ISP or other outsider supplier, and it knows which different DNS servers it needs to solicit to determine the name from a site with its IP address. The servers that really have the required data are called definitive DNS servers.
