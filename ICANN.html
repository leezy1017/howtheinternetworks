<h1><b> What is ICANN </b></h1>

<p align="left-side">
ICANN is under contract with the commerce department. With the transition on the way, the department would have had to send a letter to ICANN renewing their contract on the past Thursday, September 15. They didn’t. now they are transferring to a more open control system. 
Now the world will control ICANN instead of just the united states.  </p>
<p align="left-side">
Which means that the entire world now has power over IP addresses and domain names. This can be a scary thing or a good thing depending on how you look at it. This means that the united states will no longer be able to block domain names but this also means that the other countries of the world will have the ability to post new things as well. 
The transfer of ICANN is supposed to be finished with as early as September 30th, but that’s only if everything runs smoothly. </p> 
<p align="left-side">
They have to find a way for the program to continue to run without problems without taking it offline. If the transfer goes through without problems then normal network and internet user will not notice a thing. But I there is a fragmentation or any other thing goes wrong…the internet users could have trouble on a global scale.
